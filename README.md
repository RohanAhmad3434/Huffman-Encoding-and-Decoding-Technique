# Huffman-Encoding-and-Decoding-Technique
This C++ program demonstrates Huffman encoding and decoding. It reads text from a file, generates Huffman codes for each character, encodes the text, and then decodes it back. The encoded text is written to an output file. It provides a simple implementation of Huffman coding for data compression purposes.
